# Concrete Delivery Management System

## Overview

The **Concrete Delivery Management System** is a comprehensive tool for managing concrete delivery processes. It allows real-time analysis, synchronization, and visualization of operational data. The system operates via a web interface and integrates with a chatbot for quick updates and communication with drivers.

The system automatically syncs data from Google Sheets and receives messages from drivers about order deliveries.

The homepage displays data for the current day and the next two business days.

## Data Updates

Information is updated through:

- Synchronization of orders from Google Sheets (every 20 minutes).
- Messages from drivers via the chatbot about the status of specific orders.

‚ö† Note: The chatbot update feature works only on Warsow Zawodzie 14.

## Features

### Branch Switcher

A button to change the concrete plant branch.

### Data Display

Data is displayed for the following three business days:

- **Current day** (green background),
- **Next business day** (yellow background),
- **Following business day** (pink background).

### Data Sections

1. **ROZK≈ÅAD**: Driver schedule, availability analysis, and planning.
2. **ZAM√ìWIENIA**: List of customer orders and their changes.
3. **HARMONOGRAM ZA≈ÅADUNK√ìW**: Concrete mixer loading plan and statistics.

### 1. ROZK≈ÅAD

The **ROZK≈ÅAD** is generated by the dispatcher at the end of the workday for the following day (source: Google Sheets).

#### Forecast of First Loading Time and Number of Trips

- Analyzes the schedule and predicts the number of trips for each driver.
- Shows when the driver will pick up the first order.
- Adjusted during the workday based on delays, cancellations, etc.
- Updates based on changes in Google Sheets and messages from drivers.

#### Auto-Generated Schedule

- If the dispatcher‚Äôs schedule is unavailable, the system automatically generates one based on the **HARMONOGRAM ZA≈ÅADUNK√ìW** and the number of available drivers.
- If there are not enough drivers, the system highlights problematic periods in red and generates a table with details.

#### "Available Drivers Schedule" Chart

- Shows the number of available drivers throughout the day.
- If drivers are unavailable, the chart drops below zero (in red).

#### Optimal Number of Drivers and First Loading Time

- Analyzes the **ZAM√ìWIENIA** and **HARMONOGRAM ZA≈ÅADUNK√ìW**.
- Determines the minimum required number of drivers.
- Indicates the start time for drivers to avoid staff shortages.
